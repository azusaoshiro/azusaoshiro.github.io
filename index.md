##Welcome to my website.
I am a first-year master's student in [**IMCTS**](https://www.imc.hokudai.ac.jp/).
My main interest is Indigenous tourism in Arctic countries.

Outside of studying, I am a member of [**Koris Gaisma**](https://koris-gaisma.com/).

This is one of our performances. Please enjoy!
